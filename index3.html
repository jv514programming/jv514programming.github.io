            <p>The final course of the Special Cup featured in all Mario Kart games and is the climactic course of each game it appears. As the name suggests, these tracks are made of rainbow-colored glass or metallic surfaces that are either one color or change their color as racers pass by them, depending on the game they appear in. Most of them are transparent throughout the Mario Kart series.</p>

            <img src="anakin-racer.jpg" class="racist-img">
            
            <p><strong>Bio: </strong>A Human male born on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine.
                He later served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight, and later the Galactic Empire 
                as the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Skywalker was believed to be the one known as "The Chosen One" 
                of Jedi prophecy, destined to bring balance to the Force</p>

            <h3>Andrew "Is probably muted" Disanza</h6>
            <img src="andrew-racer.jpg" class="racist-img">
            
            <p><strong>Bio: </strong>"My secret to racing is simple. All you
                have to do is listen." says professional Iracist Andrew. "Yea see
                people want to talk, and they say all sorts of shit about who they're voting
                for, how immigrants are takin' der jobs, and wether or not they think brown people deserve to be in the country, 
                but the trick is to just agree with whatever they say. It makes life, and thus racing, easy."</p>

            <h3>Evan "The Bull Moose" Evans</h6>
            <img src="Ben-racer.jpg" class="racist-img">
            
            <p><strong>Bio: </strong>A small town midwestern boy, grown 
            into a full blown east coast Iracist, Evan "the Bull moose" Evans
            has established himself as a top tier racer. His interest in racing
            first began on his bus rides to middle school. "My bus was smaller than
            my friend's busses, so I knew it must be faster, that's why they gave me a racing
            helment to wear on my way to school. Since then, I knew I was destined to race." states Evan.</p>

            <h3>Steven "Small Arms" Volpe</h6>
            <img src="steven-racer.jpg" class="racist-img">
            
            <p><strong>Bio: </strong>Although he's never raced a car in his life, Steven spends
            his time pushing the payload from one end of the map to another. You be forgiven if you
            thought all that pushing would lead to a strong and built upper body, but steven "Small Arms"
            Volpe suffers from a rare form of muscular dystrophy, only affecting his upper torso. 
            Doctors may be puzzled by his physique, but if there's one thing they're confident about, it's that 
            Steven will use those small arms to insta-lock hanzo.</p>
